.SH NAME
easycz \- script launcher
.SH SYNOPSIS
Easy CZ (clonezilla) script launcher.
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple graphical user interface program
that admins can use to create push-button
interfaces, also known as "switchboards",
for novice users. The configuration is
done with a YAML file. There is no way for the end
user to alter the interface through this program.
This is considered a feature, not a bug.
.PP
It was originally intended to launch Clonezilla commands.
.SH OPTIONS

\-c <configfile>

.SH BUGS
Malformed YAML files don't work at all, but error messages aren't
helpful.
