easycz
======

Gtk button panel for executing scripts or commands.

Originally intended to launch Clonezilla commands or scripts.

Reminiscent of Apple's AtEase and the Lotus Notes home screen, 
but not as sophisticated.  Useful for "kiosk" situations where 
your users need to run specific scripts, and you want to present
them with an ultra-simple interface.

Will be licensed under the GPL2.

Not even "alpha" software at this time.
